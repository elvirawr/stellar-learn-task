# Crowdfund on Stellar: Learn, Build, Empower

Welcome to a hands-on journey in decentralized crowdfunding! This project is your gateway to mastering blockchain app development with Stellar, Rust, and React. Created for the Stellar Indonesia Workshop (October 2025), itâ€™s designed to help you build real-world skills and connect with the Web3 community.

## Whatâ€™s Inside?

**crowdfunding/** â€“ Modern web app built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and TailwindCSS. Features wallet integration, dynamic routing, and a smooth developer experience.

**ezcrow/** â€“ Smart contracts written in Rust using Soroban for Stellar. Includes a fully functional crowdfunding contract, plus exercises to extend and customize.
